# Product Management System (PMS)

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Product Management System (PMS) that allows CRUD operations on products. The system is built using the following technologies:

- **Backend Technologies:** `.NET 8.0`, C#, EntityFramework Core, NLog, xUnit, Moq
- **Frontend Technologies:** `Angular 17.1.1`, Angular Material Design, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, 

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that `Angular 17.1.1` and `.NET 8.0` are installed on your machine.
2. In the Root Directory, Find `DB_Script.sql` file Run it in SQL Server Management Studio to create the necessary database tables and populate them with sample data.
3. If you have some customized name of your SQL Server instance, you need to Update the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file. By Default it is set to default Local SQL Server `.\SQLEXPRESS`
4. Open the `ProductManagementSystem.sln` solution and execute it to Run Backend Web APIs (Startup project should be `PMS.API`.
4. In the root directory, You will find a folder PMS_Fronend that contains Fronend application.
5. Use the following command to run the Angular frontend:
   
   1. `npm i`  (For the first time)
   2. `ng serve`
   

## Key Features
- **Repository Pattern & Generic Repository:** Implemented these patterns to separate out data access logic from business logic.
- **AutoMapper:** Used for object-to-object mapping, reducing manual mapping code.
- **Auditing Fields:** Automatically set in all database tables using DbInterceptors.
- **Logging:** Incorporates NLog to log each request and response using custom ActionFilter. 
- **Unit Testing:** Utilizes xUnit and Moq for unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **SSDT and PMS.DB.Schema:** Tracks database schema changes and helps synchronize databases across environments.
- **Dependency Injection:** Follows the SOLID principle with proper dependency injection usage.
- **Exception Handling:** Implements structured exception handling for better error management.
- **Pagination** Implemented Pagination in Front-End and Back-End

## Project Structure
- **PMS.API:** Provides the Presentation layer for the RESTful Web API.
- **PMS.Services:** Handles Business logic and operations.
- **PMS.Repositories:** Acts as the repository layer for data access.
- **PMS.Common:** Shared project with common models and constants across different layers.
- **PMS.Test:** Contains unit tests using xUnit and Moq.
- **PMS.DB.Schema:** SQL Server database project for managing database schema changes.
- **PMS.DB.Model:** Contains database models generated by Entity Framework.

## Running Tests
To run unit tests, navigate to the `PMS.Test` project and execute the test cases.
